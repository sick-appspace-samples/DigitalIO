## DigitalIO
Using digital input/output ports
### Description
Digital output is toggled depending on digital input state and state changes.  Script observes digital input #1 ("DI1") for changes. The digital output #1
("DO1") is toggled when digital input #2 ("DI2") is set to high. If DI2
is set to low, the output stays unchanged.
### How to Run
The FullFeatured Emulator can be used to demonstrate this script. To toggle the input
states the keyboard shortcuts (Key-1, Key-2) must be used in the emulator tab
